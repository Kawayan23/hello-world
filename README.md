A bit about myself, i am a graduate of Bs in Information Technology at Palawan State University(PalSU) located at the City of Puerto Princesa, Palawan.
I have a 'Best in Programming' award in my Highschool graduation.
I love gaming and movie marathon, as well as researching about things i'm curious about.
Currently taking web development refresher courses to job my programming mind and do some upskilling along the way.
That's it for Step 3.
